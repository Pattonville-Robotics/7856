# 7856 Blood, Sweat, & Gears

This repository holds the code for FTC Team 7856 Blood Sweat and Gears. The goal is to write programs that will accomplish several goals during the 2016-2017 FTC game Velocity Vortex, such as controlled and autonomous movement, detecting and pressing color beacons, and launching particles into the center vortex. We organize our code into opmodes and robotclasses. The opmodes package holds our Autonomous and TeleOp files, and the robotclasses package holds the code for each mechanism on the robot. You can read more about our project in the 7856 Wiki, or on the Pattonville Robotics website at http://robotics.psdr3.org
